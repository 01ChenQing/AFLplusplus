# autotokens

This implements an improved autotoken grammar fuzzing idea presented in
[Token-Level Fuzzing][https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec21-salls.pdf].
It is a grammar fuzzer without actually knowing the grammar.

It is recommended to run with together in an instance with `CMPLOG`.

If you have a dictionary (`-x`) this improves this custom grammar mutator.

If **not** running with `CMPLOG`, it is possible to set
`AFL_CUSTOM_MUTATOR_ONLY` to concentrate on grammar bug classes.
